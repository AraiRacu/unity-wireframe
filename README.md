## Usage

* Add the `Wireframe` directory to your Unity project's `Assets` directory.
* To use the wireframe shaders, set your material's shader to `SuperSystems/Wireframe`, `SuperSystems/Wireframe-Transparent`, or `SuperSystems/Wireframe-Transparent-Culled`.
* To use the replacement shader image effect, add the `WireframeImageEffect` component to your camera.
