# Unity Wireframe Shaders

These are general purpose wireframe shaders adapted from Unity's built-in SpatialMappingWireframe shader.

## Usage

* Add the shaders to your Unity project's `Assets` directory.
* Set your material's shader to `SuperSystems/Wireframe` or `SuperSystems/Wireframe-Transparent`.
